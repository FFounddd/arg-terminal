Found has been spending more time in R&D on Level 3 than anywhere else these days.<span class="glitch">E</span>
He says he's just monitoring the crystal's stability. But it's more than that. <span class="glitch">Y</span>
He's talking to it.<span class="glitch">E</span>

I’ve seen the way it pulses—like it’s listening. Or worse, like it’s answering back.<span class="glitch">S</span>
Something’s resonating inside it. Not energy. Not signal. Not anything we’ve been able to categorize.<span class="glitch">-</span>
It feels divine. Wrong. Like God is trying to slip through a crack in reality we accidentally chiseled.<span class="glitch">O</span>

The others don’t feel it, but I do. The hum in my skull. The pressure in my chest.<span class="glitch">F</span>
It speaks in dreams. Even the lights flicker when Found’s close.<span class="glitch">-</span>

Yesterday he snapped at Medea.<span class="glitch">G</span>
He *never* snaps at Medea.<span class="glitch">O</span>
He apologized right after, fell to his knees and held her hands like a man who’d just realized he was the villain in his own play.<span class="glitch">D</span>
But it’s getting worse.

Every day, he's thinner. Louder. Quieter. Flickering.

We’ve awoken something. And it’s inside him now. I just hope he doesn't fall any farther.
